It is both terrifying and exciting starting a blog. To add to the discomfort, these are completely new waters I'm treading. It's like jumping into a pit who's bottom you can't see.

## Group project

Over the course of 12 weeks, 4 people including myself have been working on a website. The website is just there to build our skills as developers. The website my team and I are building is aimed towards artists of all shapes and sizes. The site is called **Electra**. The goal of Electra is to help artists collaborate with each other. For example, you have a piece of art that you feel could improve but you need another set of eyes on the piece as a whole or just part of the piece. The artist would then recieve feedback/critique from the artist community on how the art could be improved or modified.

During the beginning stages of this project, we wanted to make sure our decisions were well thought out but also fast. To do this we utilized the Agile framework, Scrum. _Agile_ is simply iterating your process quickly and a bunch of times to pump out a project. Scrum works in sprints which is usually 1 to 2 weeks depending on the scope of your project. It is self-organizing with each team lead by a Scrum Master, a role that revolves within team members, and the product owner. The Scrum Master's role is to make sure the team is working with the principles of Agile, is on task, not distracted, and makes sure the backlog is always up to date. Our team utilizes the Kanban board which has four parts. The backlog(tasks to do), in progress, review and done. These four parts ensure the team stays organized and keeps the code error-free.

Next Post: Will focus on the process of how we designed and prototyped our site.
